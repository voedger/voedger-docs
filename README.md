# Introduction

**Voedger** is an all-in-one **server platform**  for the deployment, execution, and management of specialized applications distributed worldwide (**Voedger Applications**).  A Voedger Application includes a description of the data schema (using VSQL language) and one or many WASM modules.

The Voedger platform was initially designed by unTill Software Development Group B. V. to operate [unTill Air](https://untillair.com/) product line and has been further developed together with other contributors.

The name "Voedger" is a blend of "Voyager" and "Edge Computing," reflecting its coming capability to process data across the edge of the network.

## Why do you need Voedger?

If you want to **save money and time** - you might need **Voedger**. We beleive that with Voedger you can cut **backend** development and operation costs up to 10x.

Why Voedger does save costs? It replaces or hides the whole modern technology stack that is used to build distributed applications:

There's no need to learn, select, and integrate these technologies. With Voedger, you can focus only on what truly matters for your business. Voedger offers significant advantages to:

**Business Owners**

- Save your money by an order of magnitude.

**Product Owners**

- Focus your team's efforts on business objectives rather than complex system programming challenges.
- Reduce the time to market for new features, reducing it to weeks instead of months, or months instead of years.

**System Architects**

- **Choosing a technology stack**. You do not need to choose technology stack components. Voedger is all-in-one, no choice.
- **Solution architecture**. Leverage an already developed, efficient architecture.

**Developers**

- **System programming**. Creating users, authentication, authorization, sharding, queues processing, service mesh, logging, monitoring etc. - save your time, it is already implemented.
- **Application programming**. Describe data and data transformations using VSQL. Need more? Easily extend functionality with your own Extensions; the development process is straightforward.
- **Performance optimization**. Comes optimized - caching, sharding, batching, zero memory allocations in hot paths etc.

**DevOps**

- **Be cloud-agnostic**. Just provide nodes running vanilla Linux, and Voedger will do the rest.
- **Deployment**. Zero Downtime Deployment is at your service.
- **Logging and monitoring**. Dashboards, alerts, logs - all in one place, configured and ready to use.

## What can Voedger do?

Voedger platform is perfect to build and operate software aimed to store and process data in multiple clusters around the world. We beleive that Voedger can be a good choice for applications in the following domains:

- Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe management
- Issue/Project management
- Online stores
- Internet of Things
- Messengers, social networks

## What Voedger is NOT

Voedger is NOT a good choice for **game** and **blockchain** applications since storing data is not a primary goal of such applications or data is kept decentralized.
