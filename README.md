# Introduction

Voedger is an all-in-one platform that cuts **backend development and operation costs up to 10x. Voedger is designed to create and operate the backend of applications that store and process data distributed worldwide.

## Why you need Voedger?

If you want to save money and time - you might need Voedger. Why Voedger saves development costs? It replaces or hides the whole modern technology stack that is used to build distributed applications:

You should not learn, choose and intergate all these technologies. Just use Voedger and focus on what your business needs. Voedger is beneficial for:

**Business owners**

**Product owners**

- Focus your team on the needs of the business, not on system programming.

**System Architects**

- **Choosing a technology stack**. You do not need to choose technology stack components. Voedger is all-on-one, no choice.
- **Solution architecture**. Effective architecture is already developed, just use it.

**Developers**

- **System programming**. Creating users, authentication, authorization, sharding, sync, queues processing, service mesh, logging, monitoring etc. - save your time, it is already implemented.
- **Application programming**. Describe most of your needs using VSQL. It is not enough? Provide your own Extensions, development process is very easy.
- **Performance optimization**. Comes optimized - caching, sharding, batching, zero memory allocations in hot paths etc.

**DevOps**

- **Deployment**. Zero Downtime Deployment is at your service.
